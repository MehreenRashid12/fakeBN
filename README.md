# fakeBN: A Probabilistic Framework for Fake News Detection

**fakeBN** is a Bayesian Network-based probabilistic framework designed to detect fake news on social media networks. This repository contains a sample implementation of fakeBN and experimental setups to assess its performance.

### File Descriptions

- **`data.zip`**: A compressed file containing all the necessary datasets required for implementing fakeBN. To access the datasets in the notebooks, extract the `data` folder from `data.zip` and place it in a new folder named `fakeBN` within your MyDrive on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com). (Path: Google Drive → My Drive → `fakeBN`).
- **`significant_events.ipynb`**: A notebook with the code to generate a dataset of significant events from 2009-2022 by scraping data from [On This Day](https://www.onthisday.com). The resulting dataset is added to the data folder.
- **`final_data.ipynb`**: A notebook that constructs the final dataset for experimentation using the [TruthSeeker dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/truthseeker-2023.html) and the significant events list. The generated dataset is included in the data folder.
- **`fakeBN.ipynb`**: A notebook with the code for implenataion and experimentatal scenarios for evaluating fakeBN framework.
